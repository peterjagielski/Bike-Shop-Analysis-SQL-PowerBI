# Bike-Shop-Analysis-SQL-PowerBi

The process of creating a data analysis project using SQL and Power BI started with uploading data to an SQL database hosted on my computer. I then wrote SQL queries using commands like JOIN and UNION ALL to combine and refine the data into a useful format. The analysis aimed to answer questions such as sales hours, revenue by season, rider demographics, and profit margin. Using Power BI's SQL connection feature, I connected Power BI to the existing SQL database and imported the refined data into the tool. Finally, I created a dashboard in Power BI that included various charts and filters, enabling interactive exploration of the data and providing insights into all the key questions.
